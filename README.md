<p align="center">Our simplified implementation of the simple shell in C language<p>
  <br></br>

## üèÜ Challenge Project

The project was to write a simple UNIX command interpreter as part of the HolbertonSchool training course. 

Our simple shell should behave like the original, with a few less features that can be added later to complete it.

This project brings together a large part of the knowledge acquired in order to succeed in making a simple shell as close as possible to the original.
<br></br>
## ‚úÖ Project Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/hs-hq/Betty/blob/main/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/hs-hq/Betty/blob/main/betty-doc.pl)
- Your shell should not have any memory leaks
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All your header files should be include guarded

## ü§® How to use the Simple Shell

This simple shell project uses several standard libraries contained in C. So you will need:
- `<stdio.h>`
- `<stdlib.h>`
- `<string.h>`
- `<unistd.h>`
- `<sys/wait.h>`
- `<sys/types.h>`
- `<ctype.h>`

You can compile all `.c` files with the following `gcc`:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```
This will give you the executable file `hsh`.

Then type the command:

```
./hsh
```
To see the simple shell prompt appear.

```
Shell'Don$
```
You can now type in the commands you want to execute, like the one below
<br></br>
## How Simple Shell Works

After receiving a command, our Simple Shell tokenizes it into words using a space " ", a tabulation " \t ", or a new line " \n ", as a delimiter. The first word is considered the command, and all remaining words are considered arguments for that command. The Simple Shell then proceeds with the following actions:
If the first character is a forward slash " / ", the Simple Shell will recognize it as a path and will execute the command without further actions.
If the first character is not a forward slash " / ", the Simple Shell will check if the input is a built-in command; if it is, the shell will execute it. If it's not a built-in command, the shell will proceed to search each element of the PATH environmental variable for a directory containing an executable file with that name.

For example, with the `ls` command which displays the list of files in the current directory:\
If the user knows the path of the command:
```
 Shell'Don$ /bin/ls
```
The simple shell will execute it directly.

On the other hand, if the user does not know the path, they can type the command directly:
```
Shell'Don$  ls
```
In this case, the simple shell will look for the address of the command in the environment so that it can be executed correctly.

## Testing

Here are a few examples of the commands we tested in order to validate the proper implementation of our Simple Shell :

- Command: ls

Shell'Don$ ls
AUTHORS  get_env.c       get_stdin.c  get_white_space.c  hshFinal     main.h  README.md  script.sh  test
free.c   get_exec_cmd.c  get_token.c  hsh

## üö™ Exit

The simple shell returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax error occurs, with zero indicating success and non-zero indicating failure. All builtins return 0 on success and 1 or 2 on failure (indicated by a corresponding error message).

## üìñ Our Man Page

We have also created a corresponding man page for the Simple shell providing detailed information about its usage and available format specifiers. To access the man page, run the following command in your terminal

## To execut  the man page 
- the command is : man  ./man_simple_shell
